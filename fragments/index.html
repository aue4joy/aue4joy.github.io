  <h2>What is Aue?</h2>
  <p>
    With religion as faith, practice, and perhaps doctrine, Aue is an atheistic religion. The faith
    Aue asks for is in society, and that the practice of consistently evaluating joy & woe in
    society is beneficial. It considers us as a modern species extraordinarily dependant on one
    another.
  </p>
  <p>
    The joy/woe dichotomy is the lens used to guide adherents. Aue strives for the peace and
    community of religion, without supernatural dogma. A concise base which, after deliberation,
    should be timeless and agreeable. It should help to ground one in materialism and understand
    themselves and their relationship with others.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is authored by Patrick Bowen, and is still <b>open doctrine</b>, subject to minor change. If
    one wishes to adapt Aue itself please use a different name.
