    ["ab", "Thinking wisely for Aue could be something to know for what part is deeply expressed through the religion. It can be perhaps thinking to truly know something sensitive and we may take this as sharing ideas or sharing the meanings of the religion as said in the verses <i>c</i> and <i>g</i>. Believing something through it and believing our strengths and abilities is actually important for us living because something you can't believe on a thing could make you think that this thing could go wrong or go in something that can be the opposite side of what we are thinking, we should need  to believe as well our abilities as we need to use this to show our strength and know what we can carry on or have something to know through."],
    ["c", "Sharing, keeping or preserve, and quote for joy is something that I got deeply interacted with as of now. Sharing for joy is like sharing happiness with everyone else as the saying \"sharing is caring\" of course! Preserve joy could let us tell about something keeping our self-happiness as it sounds like your protecting it against depression and pessimistic feelings. Lastly, Citing or quoting joy sounds like you want to tell everyone about something on how you feel happy or telling everyone about how your joy could be an interesting part of your life and others as well."]
