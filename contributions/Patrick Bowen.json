Aue is not written so much for its face value, rather to be studied until understood, with serious attitude.\nThe opinions encourage a regular revision of Aue in respect to one's life, and publicly so."

Aue has no conditional clause saying \"have faith, only when times are good\"; you are asked to have faith not only in Aue, but yourself.\nWith study one could make peace with Aue, so even in the hardest times, or the quickest judgements, you can rely on it. My opinions also ask that you remain humble when times are good, and not to shun Aue or others.\nOther citations to it regard its propagation. There must be belief in it and understanding if to be taught without restraint, translated without misjudgment, celebrated without feeling false. Thankfully, with group and personal revision, few should be unable to do this!"

Translation, summaries, conversation, and education are all important facets of this.\nWhat is preservation of knowledge? It is immortalising through accurate copies, guarded from misunderstanding. Language changes, and English is no exception.\nAnd now is a good time to focus on a core concept of Aue: <b>joy</b>. A state of happiness, felicity, it is mentioned throughout Aue, coveted. Further verses will allude to its relationship with <b>woe</b>. Aue asks in verse <i>k</i>: <b>Know of woe and seek joy happily.</b>\nTherefore an adherent should include these revelations in their revisions, summaries, and remember what Aue clearly states to be: <b>Share, preserve, exalt it for joy</b>."

      "Ephemeral uniqueness. This is the first of the substantial verses of Aue which make hard assertions. One can also tell this by seeing it is heavily referenced in my opinions.\nAue has a materialistic view of the world, rooted in science; the human brain is certainly theoretically capable of being conscious, smart, emotional, etc, as a self-contained organ. \nThis verse is about the miraculous existence of us as individuals, and of nature, our eventual waste, and the impracticality of our reformation after the fact. Our bodies aren't very unique and have been replicated billions of times, but our personalities are a distinct artefact. Alas, they are bound to our organic constitution, currently susceptible to total decay. After this decay, the unique cluster of brain matter constituting our individuality is lost.\nThe opinions of this verse address <i>perimortem</i> (just before and after death) issues of us and nature. The protection of what we have now through <i>Ecology</i>; dashing the futile wish for your corpse to be undisturbed (as it shall be anyway); the first of many reasons why bodily violation is a disturbing wrong; why one should keep healthy if wishing to preserve one's existence; and, if not wanting to preserve your existence, being assisted to expedite its end."

Not just the death of us, but of all beings, and nature as a whole.\nIt is the harsh reality that from now until the heat death of the universe, our unique, contiguous consciousnesses won't reform. Assuredly, each mundane atom of one's mind and body will seep into nature, eventually subside into the Earth's mantle just before its almost total destruction through the inflation of the Sun. Beyond this, for trillions of years, it will not matter - you will have scattered long ago.\nMy opinions citing <i>e</i> draw upon this."

      "Some wonder why there is joy and woe in the world at the same time, why it is experienced unequally. It is simply nature and the fittest way to survive our environments. Plants and even microbes will respond to positive and negative stimuli&mdash;a dichotomy that we intelligent beings apply. They do not understand what is positive and negative, with only genetic impetus. These genes are the product of innumerable mutations alongside innumerable environmental pressures&mdash;evolution. Our acute sense of joy and woe is owed to our consciousness.\nThe most familiar yet most mysterious aspect of our lives is consciousness. An arguably beautiful character of this is sympathy - a linchpin of both society and Aue. It is not just good for good's sake, but a winning trait of our species. The opinions commencing with a <i>f</i> citation encourage this good both in oneself and for others. <i>Phobias</i> encourages addressing irrational fears; <i>Charity</i> encourages material aid and ongoing easement for those in need; <i>Veganism</i> strictly encourages reducing harm to animals currently enslaved through societal inertia; <i>Abortion</i> addresses pregnancy and its termination as valuable only before it could effect woe&mdash;thankfully plenty of time to make a decision."

We share the precious conditions we have, and therefore should be conscious of our effects.\nThe previously seen opinions here, such as <i>Ecology</i>, <i>Veganism</i>, etc, focus on these relationships to bolster good. The new opinions include defining a relationship between parents and offspring; encouraging cooperation over competition; a reminder of our actions impacting those in the future; of participating in research as we are of one another; and a small refutation on the nature of our seemingly designed universe&mdash;life, (evolved) together, share (and have shared) the universe.\nOf course, it is up to us to be good.

This means we should take care to use our life well, and realise how precious it is.\nWith previous opinions, some opinions commencing with <i>h</i> are <i>Slavery</i>, to help ensure nobody lives their life without freedom; <i>Shame</i> to help ensure nobody restricts their life choices just because others feel offended; <i>Exercise</i> a short simple encouragement for the gym to not just waste energy on resistance; <i>Technological inertia</i> encourages being aware of (seeking) socially valuable technology that should be adopted without delay, factoring in hardships.\nMore opinions may draw upon this verse just to remind people to not waste their lives.

Its ~84 words can only be written in a way that after study it makes sense, then causes change. Of course you could approach anybody on the street and say: <b>Know of woe and seek joy happily.</b> But while this verse is one of the most important, it is only words, and it's up to the adherent to effect its importance.\nIn religion there is often dichotomy between good & evil, virtue & sin, and joy & woe is of Aue. <b>Know of woe</b> is an entire life's journey with conscious, empathetic heart and mind. It means to uncover all national plight, all manner of personal grievance, and even the condition and treatment of life itself. <b>and seek joy</b> is on this same path, to effect it in both yourself and others.\nYou've read the words, now <i>a</i> <b>Think sensibly for Aue;</b> and read them again to inspire action!"

And yet as human beings we would be unrecognisable without society, and non-existent without nature.\nSociety is the sum of all our interactions with one another, and can be shared with anybody except by yourself alone. By trusting & relying on nature & society, we accept a part of ourselves just as important as our flesh. We can understand it better, and empathise with it easier."

      "One might find it apparent to oppose harm to others, but this verse serves as the steadfast reminder. Aue lays out the character of joy & woe, and asks for this to be consistently kept in mind, and its diversity investigated.\nSentient beings also make up our society. Opposing harm and raising compassion involves numerous actions.\nTaking anthropogenic climate change as a currently most important issue, it will take massive corrections and pressures in our behaviour and governance to address. The normalisation and unnecessary systematic torture and slaughter of billions of animals globally must be addressed. Hundreds of millions of individuals globally are suffering in war, persecution, genocide, poverty, hunger, economic debt, slavery, and more, and must be saved. And locally, there may be individuals or families in need which can be directly helped. These issues, an adherent of Aue should tackle head-on, for joy.\nBut how much should one change? Where is the line drawn? This is a question that can regress into a return to primitive life, antinatalism, or even excuse suicide. But this insults our capacity for doing rational good, and incites apathy; we all have the ability to seek out, prioritise, and create real lasting impact in this world. It is with faith that adherents of Aue should do this, and never stop. <i>b</i> <b>believe in it & your abilities.</b>"

      "Unfortunately, it's virtually impossible for all animals (us included) to behave in such a way that woe is reduced only to natural misfortune. Whether through nature or nurture, some of us have taken a vocation of causing harm to others in a wide range of ways. This verse serves as a reminder, that woe is not just inherent to our mortal condition but can be caused by others. Thankfully there is a human capacity to bring only joy to others to some degree.\nThis verse may address a victim or a culprit. For a victim, there is reminder that <i>some</i> woe is malicious, calculated, but therefore subject to change. For a culprit, there is no inherent virtue or sin, no eternal damnation, karma or curses, and therefore opportunity to change.\nTruly capable subverting of societal joy is by other social beings; seeking peace is a vital process of dialectics, and unfortunately sometimes attrition."

      "Ignorance and naivety is not malicious; we are all ignorant of things in varying degrees. However, perpetual ignorance, either upon oneself or others, we have seen does contribute to woe. This may be in the way we interact with others socially, opinions and mannerisms we inherit, continuing to do something we know is wrong, not questioning something we've been informed may be wrong, not speaking up or intervening in a situation we know is preventable.\nMost of the time, we're all correct and taking a path which is unharmful beyond reasonable doubt. But it's those minority instances that can change ourself and the lives of others dramatically. Aue asks one to be aware of woe, and act on it; exhibit this to others in the face of ignorance. It is best to demonstrate a good path, not to judge, nor chastise, nor force."

      "To me, \"faith\" and \"science\" are not mutually exclusive. Interacting with all other people we have ingrained in us a workable level of trust for relationships, business, peace, and guardianship, among others. It is no law of physics&mdash;you have my word&mdash;that money guarantees service, affection guarantees loyalty, or that treaties are eternal. This in mind, the human pursuits of science and academia do not guarantee truth.\nIt has been very apparent in lay and opposing peoples that distrust of institutions and authority lead to distrust in otherwise sound method and reproducibility.\nThough Antiscience is a pestilence, how the most critically acclaimed, even benign institutions are verified and trusted should be understood, countering blind trust. This will only be good for our society as a whole.\nWith this ever-critical faith, we can be more sure of the conclusions of specialists and experts, institutions, and foundational knowledge, for joy. Scientific method and knowledge are inexorable and indispensable for effective adherence to Aue."

      "This final verse of Aue follows after asking for critical trust in science and knowledge. Aue up until now has asked for one to be increasingly well aware of the joy and woe in this world, to side for society's joy, and propagate these priorities. It has also made various assertions, tying into this, about our origins, drives, and endings, which are rooted in materialist understanding. Aue itself certainly has intention of using materialist conclusions as solutions.\nTo quote Albert Einstein:\n“Science … cannot create ends and, even less, instil them in human beings; science, at most, can supply the means by which to attain certain ends. But the ends themselves are conceived by personalities with lofty ethical ideals and&mdash;if these ends are not stillborn, but vital and vigorous&mdash;are adopted and carried forward by those many human beings who, half unconsciously, determine the slow evolution of society.”"
