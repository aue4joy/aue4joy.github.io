  "body": "Secular Humanism and Atheistic Satanism\nAue, Secular Humanism, and Atheistic Satanism reject supernatural and superstitious beliefs, embracing science. Aue would be largely understood as a Humanist life stance if it were not for a component of faith. It also does not concern itself directly with other modes of belief, such as Satanism blatantly does, and Humanist movements concern themselves with often. However, when other modes of belief cause woe, an Aue adherent should seek peace and demonstrate Aue in face of it. \n\nSecular Humanism\nAue includes all sentient life as part of its concerns, which some Humanist and Satanist movements will also but not inherently so.\n\nAtheistic Satanism\nAs a former Satanic Temple affiliate, I can comment that Aue does not have focus on individualism, aesthetics, and its verses target more broad concepts than Satanist tenants. Aue also takes a strict stance to the use and abuse of animals and nature, as opposed to the lax Satanist culture.\n\nAue asks an adherent to adopt faith in both itself and themselves (b believe in [Aue] & your abilities). This is an important component of Aue, and if a person feels Aue no longer serves them beneficially their adherence should cease. Aue's doctrine is still open to revision by myself, but the largest body of thought is from interpretations. Aue's doctrine will not change drastically, and is not meant to. If there is need for drastic change it should be considered a different religion, and that is fine. If Aue one day becomes completely irreconcilable or unpopular with humanity it will simply fall out of relevance.\nIt also asks for one to negotiate empathetically with society and others, and have faith in the social capabilities of our species."
