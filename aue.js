  "verseDescriptions": [
    ["a", `I find this really important right now, in the early days of Aue being shared, where it's conceivable only I have read Aue and understood.
<b>Here, use intelligence & sensibility.</b> It's a very direct verse, calling upon innate abilities we all have, to discover Aue. Aue is not written for its face value, it is written to be read again & again until understood, with sensibility â€“ a serious attitude. <b>Here, use intelligence & sensibility.</b>
The interpretations encourage a regular revision of Aue in respect to one's life, and publicly so.`],
    ["b", `This verse is cited in the first five interpretations of Aue, and touches upon not just its own propagation, but also on a time which can be really hard to keep faith - austerity.
    One may read Aue, understand, and benefit, but when times are tough it can be easy to drop empathy and abandon any "peace-time" morals. Aue has no conditional clause saying "have faith, only when times are good"; you are asked to have faith not only in Aue, but yourself - your own ability to understand.
    With revision you should have made peace with the knowledge Aue provides, so even in the hardest times, or the quickest judgements, you can rely on it. It also asks that you remain humble when times are good, and not to shun Aue or others.
    Other citations to it are to its propagation and celebration. You must have faith in its meaning, and your understanding, if you are to teach it without restraint, to translate it without misjudgement, to celebrate it without feeling false. Thankfully, with group and personal revision, few should be unable to do this!
    Have faith in Aue & your ability to understand`],
    ["c", `This verse, like the previous two, focus mostly on gaining a position in your life, and its propagation to others. It claims to inspire joy, and so this should be shared and preserved.
    What is sharing? It is making it accessible to others. Translation, summaries, conversation, and education are all important facets of this.
    What is preservation of knowledge? It is immortalising through accurate copies, guarded from misunderstanding. Language changes, and English is no exception.
    And now is a good time to focus on a core concept of Aue: <b>joy</b>. A state of happiness, felicity, it is mentioned throughout Aue, coveted. Further verses will allude to its relationship with <b>woe</b>. Aue asks in verse <i>k</i>: <b>Know of woe, & seek out joy with joy & praise.</b>
    Therefore an Auen should include these revelations and praises in their revisions, summaries, and always remember what Aue clearly states to be: <b>This is knowledge, to be shared, preserved, inspiring joy.</b>`],
    ["d", `Remarkably not the shortest verse in Aue, it states that because you now have access to the Aue doctrine that you could rejoice. However, do not mistaken pointing at the moon for the moon itself! The first time you read this verse you won't be feeling particularly joyful.
    Remember, Aue is to be revised and read over and over until it makes sense for you. Each time you read across this verse - and you should, as all are important - you will hopefully feel the joy has grown. And, one might also feel the need to impart this knowledge onto others as I am.
    Two new interpretations that cite this verse are <i>Reflection</i> and <i>Gratitude</i>. These constitute a reflection upon reality, and particularly a gratuitous reflection for those who bring you joy. Gratitude has a fairly weak citation, but just as you might feel joy for Aue, rejoice for other things in life - a recurring cycle. Aue is all about seeing the wonderful opportunity for joy we were born into, and the capacity we have for it, with billions of fellow humans, an uncountable number of other beings, and having been born from the exact conditions for our livelihood.
    And so I do sincerely hope, dear reader, you will be able to feel some joy; <b>it is shared to you, rejoice!</b>`],
    ["e", `Aue has asked an adherent to rejoice for Aue being shared to them, and now it asks that one record and preach the joy. What is the joy? It's not just this joy - the sharing. The joy it speaks of is all that you discover through the lens of Aue. In further verses one is asked to seek out joy in response to woe, and to demonstrate Aue in response to woeful behaviour. Further, we are asked to do this with joy and praise.
    <b>Record & preach the joy.</b> Why? To help the propagation of Aue and therefore the joy that comes with it, and to codify appraisal and history. One could quietly and solitarily follow Aue, but that would virtually denying any benefits one experiences for others.`],
    ["f", `Ephemeral uniqueness. This is the first of the substantial verses of Aue which make hard assertions. One can also tell this by seeing it is the first citation of five heavily-referenced interpretations. The shape and size of verse references can tell you a lot about its nature. 
    Aue has a materialistic view of the world, rooted in science; the human brain is certainly theoretically capable of being conscious, smart, emotional, etc, as a self-contained organ. 
    This verse is about the miraculous existence of us as individuals, and of nature, our eventual waste, and the impracticality of our reformation after the fact. Our bodies aren't very unique and have been replicated billions of times, but our personalities are a distinct artefact. Alas, they are bound to our organic constitution, currently susceptible to total decay. After this decay, the unique cluster of brain matter constituting our individuality is lost. Notice, this verse is written as "is formed now only" not "forms only now" or "exists only now" etc; it is not speaking of nature and bodily constitution existing only here and now in the universe, but rather the instances of it this instant, as you read. In fact there is likely extra-terrestrial life.
    The interpretations of this verse address <i>perimortem</i> (just before and after death) issues of us and nature. The protection of what we have now through <i>Ecology</i>; dashing the futile wish for your corpse to be undisturbed (as it shall be anyway); the first of many reasons why bodily violation is a disturbing wrong; why one should keep healthy if wishing to preserve one's existence; and, if not wanting to preserve your existence, being assisted to expedite its end.`],
    ["g", `Leading on after verse <i>f</i> is a reminder of death. Not just the death of us, but of all beings, and nature as a whole.
    It is the harsh reality that from now until the heat death of the universe, our unique, contiguous consciousnesses won't reform. Assuredly, each mundane atom of one's mind and body will seep into nature, eventually subside into the Earth's mantle just before its almost total destruction through the inflation of the Sun. Beyond this, for trillions of years, it will not matter - you will have scattered long ago.
    The new interpretations citing <i>g</i> draw upon this.`]
