      The impetus for Aue as a missionary faith is both implicit and explicit.
      It is <i>implicit</i> in the sense that it is every new faith&rsquo;s
      overarching objective to gain new adherents — conversion is the raison
      d&rsquo;etre of organised religion; without it a prospective faith is merely the
      sum of the interior thoughts of its would-be founder, passing from
      immateriality to immateriality. In order for the teachings of Aue to truly
      benefit the people they are meant to help — humanity, but also all
      creatures — they must necessarily be propagated. Luckily this challenge is
      an <i>explicit</i> one as well, one that the verses directly give a voice
      to: the missionary drive is as clearly spelled out as the Biblical command
      to baptise all nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verse <i>c</i> is, of course, the cornerstone of any examination of Aue in
      relation to the mission field; the bright and compelling exhortation to
      "share, preserve, cite it for joy." Immediately after <i>b</i> calls us to
      believe in Aue and our innate ability we&rsquo;re asked to deepen our belief and
      engage our abilities by sharing Aue with others, preserving its doctrines,
      and citing them as we go about our lives. That we do this "for joy" is
      both a premise and a promise; sharing Aue with others is something which
      is <i>grounded</i> in joy (the joy of seeing Aue work for our benefit in
      our own lives which first compels us to share it) but is also something
      which will <i>result</i> in joy: the innumerable waves of which will
      spread from one adherent to the next as its doctrines are tried and found
      satisfying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other verses of Aue lend purpose and urgency to the work of their
      propagation: <i>d</i> and <i>e</i> remind us that our time is drawing
      short, the hour ever more near, and act to inspire us to spread the
      teachings to as many people as we can during the brief amount of time we
      find ourselves travelling together. Verse <i>g</i>&rsquo;s instruction to "share
      the universe" can be read as a gloss on <i>c</i>, insofar as the
      difference between sharing Aue and sharing the universe could be thought
      of as negligible — if all that one requires in life to court joy and keep
      woe at bay are the verses of Aue, could they not be said to contain the
      universe within them, all that we need? Verse <i>h</i> makes explicit the
      implications of <i>d</i>-<i>e</i> as we acknowledge the fleeting
      volatility of time and are told to "make [it] precious" through our
      actions, something which immediately lends itself to the idea of
      proselytising and its utility as time well-spent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verse <i>j</i> situates the following verses in context; nature and
      society are our habitat and it is within that habitat that we do the work
      of <i>k</i>, opposing harm/raising compassion, and <i>l</i>, seeking peace
      to woe. Sharing Aue with others can (and perhaps ought to) be seen as a
      vital tool for raising compassion and seeking peace because in propagating
      the doctrines we encourage both — holding out the religion as a salve for
      the woes which afflict those around us. If more people became adherents of
      Aue its values would disseminate continually and affect broader and
      broader swathes of society until it fulfilled the promise of <i>k</i>-<i
        >l</i
      >
      on a corporate scale as opposed to an individual one. Further rippling
      outward as a form of missionary work would be the good advice of <i>m</i>.
      To &rsquo;show Aue&rsquo; is truly the work of a lifetime, but showing something is
      useless if there&rsquo;s nobody there to see it. Through demonstrating to
      onlookers the resilience that Aue grants its adherents we can lead by
      example and encourage others, intrigued by our joy, to pursue Aue as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verse <i>o</i>, the final verse, ends with a last command. Not merely to
      wield Aue for joy in our own lives but rather to "grow it", to export that
      joy and show others how to grasp it. Sharing and growing Aue benefits
      those who are lead to embrace it through our missionary endeavours but
      also redounds to the benefit of those doing the sharing, bringing
      fellowship, renewed faith, and strengthened bonds. Although the work of
      spreading a religion is difficult it is also necessary for the religion&rsquo;s
      health and infinitely rewarding for proselytisers and proselytes alike; I
      hope that by outlining the support of the verses of Aue for such
      activities I can inspire some faint flame of missionary zeal in an
      adherent.
