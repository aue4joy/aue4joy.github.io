      <i>f</i>: Art is a sign that we do know about joy and woe cause of the
      sentience/sapience from evolution. Cause of how emotion is conveyed
      through art. We can weave so many messages about happiness, sadness and
      the so many other emotions we have through books/paintings/movies
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I can move to verse <i>i</i>. Thinking of verse i can help someone
      recognize a bad situation their in &ldquo;Know of woe&rdquo; and motivate
      them to improve where they are &ldquo;seek joy happily&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      And <i>l</i> and <i>m</i>. &ldquo;Seek peace to woe incited,
      inflicted.&rdquo; &ldquo;Show Aue amid woe of misjudgment.&rdquo; Art
      could absolutely make someone think about how to apply this in their life.
      Maybe the piece of art has something to say about how to do stuff like
      that, and someone could think of whether that would help to do what
      <i>l</i> and <i>m</i> say.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an Aue adherent I think art is important to me because I think keeping
      those verses in mind could help me and any other Aue adherent think of how
      to apply compassion and joy and how to avoid causing woe through
      reflecting on the themes of art and what the art says about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Art is a way to convey emotions and messages that are just extremely
      important (important for everyone not just Aue adherents. People can
      examine these elements through their own faiths and beliefs) and Aue can
      help me interpret those messages into ways I can positively apply Aue to
      make stuff better in the world and in my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      And making art is important too cause it can help other people with this
      same stuff. Helping others with art would be showing joy to others.
