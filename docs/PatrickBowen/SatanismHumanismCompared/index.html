    <h2>Secular Humanism and Atheistic Satanism</h2>
    <p>
      Aue, Secular Humanism, and Atheistic Satanism reject supernatural and
      superstitious beliefs, embracing science. Aue would be largely understood
      as a Humanist life stance if it were not for a component of faith. It also
      does not concern itself directly with other modes of belief, such as
      Satanism blatantly does, and Humanist movements concern themselves with
      often. However, when other modes of belief cause woe, an Aue adherent
      should seek peace and demonstrate Aue in face of it.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Secular Humanism</h2>
    <p>
      Aue includes all sentient life as part of its concerns, which some
      Humanist and Satanist movements will also but not inherently so.
      <footnote>
        Late edit I can&rsquo;t resist adding: they are anthropocentric.

    <h2>Atheistic Satanism</h2>
    <p>
      As a former Satanic Temple affiliate, I can comment that Aue does not have
      focus on individualism, aesthetics, and its verses target more broad
      concepts than Satanist tenants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aue takes a strict stance to the use and abuse of animals and nature, as
      opposed to the lax Satanist culture. It also asks for one to negotiate
      empathetically with society and others, and have faith in the social
      capabilities of our species, rather than a focus on individualism.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Aue</h2>
    <p>
      Aue asks an adherent to adopt faith in both itself and themselves (<i
        >b</i
      >
      <b>believe in [Aue] &amp; your abilities</b>). This is an important
      component of Aue, and if a person feels Aue no longer serves them
      beneficially their adherence should cease. Aue&rsquo;s doctrine is still open to
      revision by myself, but the largest body of thought is from opinions.
      Aue&rsquo;s doctrine will not change drastically, and is not meant to. If there
      is need for drastic change it should be considered a different religion,
      and that is fine. If Aue one day becomes completely irreconcilable or
      unpopular with humanity it will simply fall out of relevance.

        Post-script (March 2023): This is an old article, and does not entirely
        reflect my modern understandings of both of these religions. It has been
