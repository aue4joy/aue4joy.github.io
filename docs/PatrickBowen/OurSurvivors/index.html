    <h2>Interest in ancestry</h2>
    <p>
      People often pay no heed to their origins&mdash;until recently me being one of them. I even
      dismissed late close relatives in understanding myself as a person. However, I developed a
      casual interest in prehistoric people and culture, especially the events and conditions that
      made us <i>human</i>. Society as a whole has inherited traits beyond tens of thousands of
      years old, and understanding these gives perspective to very core parts of our being.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>To begin with the dawn of humankind</h2>
    <p>
      Humility is necessary for a deep appreciation of our beginnings via evolution&mdash;we have
      been on the same path, and are subject to the same forces, as all other life. We still have
      myriad "primal" urges, bias, heuristics, focuses, and innate abilities. However, unlike most
      other animals we are incredibly social (though not as social as bees, ants, etc). We develop
      culture and bequeath stories of such, but there are stories to be found from within ourselves
      too. Our ancestors were shaped and selected by their environment&mdash;they are
      <i>our survivors</i>&mdash;with all their tastes and behaviours whittled down to who we are
      today.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subsequently, aspects of our environment and certain behaviours are desirable to us as a
      species. I would like to opine on two I consider interesting: fire and the ocean. These are
      examples of me having caught myself in allure of something natural, pondering why this might
      be, and attributing it to evolutionary past. Bear in mind these are not academic conclusions
      but thoughtful fictions.
    </p>

    <h2>Fire</h2>
    <p>
      Our ancestors, and even some <i>Homo</i> cousins such as <i>Homo neanderthalensis</i>,
      mastered fire, and its benefits were essential to our success. If you are inexplicably drawn
      to the light of a candle, the heat of a bonfire, the power of arson, I feel our ancestors are
      the cause of this. These are people who survived, period, and a healthy relationship with fire
      would have been a major advantage. If their genes dictated baulking at the smell of smoke,
      pyrophobia, or apathy to arson, survival would be threatened. Yet also interweaved with
      advantageous caution of heat and flames makes fire an almost mystical experience.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>The ocean</h2>
    <p>
      I think there are indeed many people who are awed by the sight, smell, environment, and
      potential of any vast body of water. I find it no surprise, as once again our ancestors that
      harboured such attractions would fair better. Hydrophobia, agoraphobia, or just simple boredom
      would have one miss out on all its good potential. Similarly, without respect for its
      life-threatening might, a survivor may instead have become fish food.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>It&rsquo;s all about perspective</h2>
    <p>
      There are many thoughtful fictions to be made. All courage, all love, all confidence and
      mastery passed down through our social species, some over one hundred thousand years old.
      However, we should still focus on individual heritage. While it has had ostensibly less impact
      on who we are as individuals than ten thousand generations, close family are more
      <i>uniquely us</i>. Understanding them gives a more social understanding of oneself. Rest
      assured we&rsquo;re all part of the same family regardless.
