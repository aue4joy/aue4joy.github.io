      <b>Evolution gave joy & woe, sentience.</b> Verse <i>f</i>. Within Aue,
      the theory of evolution is central. The inexorable processes working
      through nature have given rise to all life we see today, expected to apply
      even to life we have not yet seen. Just as water always finds or carves
      its way through a landscape, so too do biological creatures through their
      environments, shaped through natural selection. Even the course of society
      is at the mercy of such a fundamental force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Science, while supplying profound understanding of the inner workings,
      rightly does not assert what relationship we should have with this fact of
      life. We all have a universal heritage, but the level of apathy or
      engagement with this knowledge is up to each individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some cultures directly worship their ancestors. All cultures at least
      remember them, seeking the truth about their past. Some people can trace
      their roots back centuries, while some are entirely alienated from even
      their parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these pale in comparison with the deep past of our species. Events and
      individuals whose actions are lost to time, who set the path for people
      hundreds of thousands of years later. These animals and people, tossed
      around by fate, developed distinct faculties, desires, and emotions. Our
      individual quirks notwithstanding, we have inherited the vast majority of
      everything that makes us human, everything which makes us enjoy and suffer
      life in the ways that we do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The power of language; particular tastes, smells, sight; fear, awe,
      boredom, love, and even death are all inherited from the innumerable minds
      and bodies now wholly scattered. All joy, and all woe, are products of how
      we respond to the world around us with our innate expectations. We crave
      attention, longevity, reproduction, knowledge, preservation, and control
      over our circumstances. We loathe physical harm, social disarray, torment,
      insecurity, helplessness, and ignorance. And while each individual has
      inherited or chosen different levels of these, evolution will ensure they
      are permanent features of the sentient experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should give consideration also to our descendents, of whom we are
      ancestors. Eight billion Earthlings will be dwarfed by all those to come,
      both on Earth and among the stars. Even if you have no close biological
      descendants of your own, your ideas, your engagement in life, your care
      for others, your pollution, and even some of your words will live on to
      shape these people and animals. In fact, susceptible to millennia of
      success, you might be entirely unable to help yourself in improving future
      society. Selflessness, altruism, and long-term thinking are staples of the
      human experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      This story will continue for practically eternity, never escaping the
      dichotomy of joy and woe.
