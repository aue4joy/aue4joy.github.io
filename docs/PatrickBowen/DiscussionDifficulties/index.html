      Recently I have undertaken some outreach for Aue, consisting purely of
      joining two new Discord servers and naturally allowing Aue as a subject to
      arise. One server concerns a new Satanist movement, and the other is a
      general discussion server. The reactions, unfortunately, have largely been
      hostile. Only one person of many has been receptive to Aue, though it is
      not likely they will pursue adherence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have possibly identified some critical issues which prevented fruitful
      discussion of Aue, instead attracting cobative pseudo-debate.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>
      <i>I&rsquo;m the founder.</i> This fact makes discussion an incredibly tricky
      task, as people tend to conflate Aue with who I am as a person, and
      consider my discussion of Aue to be an egotistical exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>There are few adherents.</i> At this moment in time it is practically
      just myself. People are not likely to take a religion or similar
      endeavours &ldquo;seriously&rdquo; if it has few adherents aside from
      myself. I have previously quipped that each new adherent makes gaining
      another adherent 10% easier, up to 100% easier than it is now. That&rsquo;s
      still rather an uphill battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>A steadfast audience.</i> The membership of these servers is largely
      people who have already settled on a religion, or framework of
      understanding the world, and not only is Aue&rsquo;s comparatively alien
      approach not likely to be well-received, but even if understood would not
      likely be considered as a valid alternative to their existing beliefs.
      In-group-out-group mentality of both the religious and the atheist of
      these servers was very apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Aue is approachable, but not readable.</i> It is tough to uphold a
      difficult to understand doctrine, and claim with enough sensible reading
      and reflection that one can understand it. Aue is a very approachable text
      due to its length, but it is not a very readable text due to its
      complexity. There is a lot to unpack, and people do not appreciate that,
      even if an adherent of Aue might.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The equality in exegesis is odd.</i> As a faithful adherent, I uphold
      Aue as not necessarily infallible, but far more worthy as a framework of
      meaning than a work to be critiqued. I have carefully authored it for
      eventual agreeableness, timelessness, as a heuristic to guide its
      adherents efficiently. I do make available a lot of exegesis (my opinions,
      verse descriptions, discussions with others, etc), however, I do not
      uphold this as a part of Aue itself. <i>I</i> am certainly fallible, but
      Aue is condensed and laboured upon to make it less so. The personal works
      I put alongside Aue are held in equal regard to any present and future
      interpretations by other adherents. I am not aware of any other religion
      which so explicitly holds its founder&rsquo;s views in equal regard to other
      views&mdash;it is a strange concept, and difficult for people to
      appreciate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has given me a lot to think about in terms of how to
      &ldquo;package&rdquo; and present Aue to others, and to whom it should be
      presented. Fortunately, the issues should be alleviated with more
      adherents, as different perspectives, and more credibility, will lend to
      better future discussion.
