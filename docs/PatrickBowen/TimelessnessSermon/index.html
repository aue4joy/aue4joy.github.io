  <section>
    <p>Dear audience,</p>
    <p>
      Today, I want to talk about a certain aspect of our religion&mdash;its
      timelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I find this to be a valuable consideration, helping connect us to those of
      the past, and the future, reassuring us of Aue&rsquo;s worth.
    </p>
    <p>There is advantage in the quality over quantity that Aue employs.</p>
    <p>
      We are left, to the disappointment of those accustomed to religious tomes,
      to "connect the dots", to "fill in the blanks" with our adherence.
    </p>
    <p>We are advised only, in verse a, to think sensibly for Aue.</p>
    <p>
      We are asked in verse c to cite it for joy, despite there only being
      fifteen verses to cite.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet I find this to be wise, choosing to isolate and focus on the
      essence of life, and making adherence fit personal journey and
      circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>Aue could speak of capitalism, or homelessness, or poverty.</p>
    <p>
      It could explicitly steer us through technological upheaval, or climate
      change, or pandemic.
    </p>
    <p>But it doesn&rsquo;t. These are not permanent features of life.</p>
    <p>
      They, largely, did not exist in the past, and I implore you to join me in
      trusting that they can be solved, even within this millennium.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much of organised religion today draws upon texts concerned with
      problems made irrelevant by unforeseen advancement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, so deep are these concerns that they often deny the very
      existence of human solutions, or change, or progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some teachings can become so stale as to cause harm to others, and the
      adherent themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even geographical location is fought over, without regard to shifting
      tectonic plates, or our eventual future among the stars.
    </p>
    <p>Conversely, no part of Aue shall ever become redundant.</p>
    <p>
      Each verse could find itself ten thousand years in the past, or in the
      future, and their relevance, importance, and synergy would not diminish.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, religion such as Aue did not exist in the past.</p>
    <p>
      In our collective prehistory, our ancestors did not have science, or
      literacy, or conception of the material nature of our existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, permanent is the innate understanding of humanity that we are
      deeply, inexorably rooted in nature and the people around us.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in verse j, nature and society is our habitat, something we should
      never forget, and never reject, or deny.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as in verse d, nature, so body, so mind, are of now, we are reminded
      of our emergence, our transience, our composition, in and of the natural
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not something we will ever escape, nor should we need to&mdash;it is
      a fact of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter how augmented we might make ourselves with technology,
      compassion will still be fundamental, death will still be final, and life
      will remain diverse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assertion of verse f, evolution gave joy and woe, sentience, means we
      will forever be a product of this process.
    </p>
    <p>
      This makes certain that any conscious being, whether completely alien to
      us or just our distant descendants, will be subject to joy, and to woe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any person that can read Aue, in its original English, or translated, and
      internalise it, could benefit from adherence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Timelessness, then, is a great virtue of Aue, and one that I hope you will
      reflect upon.
    </p>
    <p>Thank you for your time.</p>
