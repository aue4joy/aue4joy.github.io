    <p>Dear audience,</p>
    <p>
      I find the joy-woe dichotomy in Aue is the most important aspect of the
      religion. It is the foundation of all ethical behaviour, a boundless
      heuristic to a good life for both yourself and others. And unlike most
      other religions, it is presented as a permanent feature of sentience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buddhism has Nirvana, Hinduism and Jainism have Moksha, Sikhism seeks
      oneness with Waheguru, and many other religions have something akin to
      eternal paradise. Leading to these are multiple paths believed to bring
      liberation from suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also non-religions, such as transhumanism, which can just as
      ardently insist there is a way out.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a noble goal, but unfortunately in vain. Not only because after
      death is scattering, and souls do not exist, but because joy and woe are
      an intrinsic part of being sentient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if each adherent of these religions attains such mental liberation,
      it is localised to them only, and may only be temporary. While the
      teachings are not necessarily damaging, they will not give the full
      picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we should not feel defeated: the balance between joy and woe can and
      ought to be influenced, for joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everlasting peace and serenity is possible, and while suffering will
      always be sustained through natural selection, it need not be a licence
      for apathy. Furthermore, as part of our nature, we possess the ability to
      face and overcome a lot of suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adhering to Aue involves being permanently aware of woe, because it is
      permanent. It involves pushing back the tide of suffering, because it is
      able to be pushed back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it is something inherent in life like hunger, or incited by others
      like hate, we can understand and overcome them, and share the true path to
      a brighter future.
    </p>
    <p>
      And we can take refuge in the certainty that joy is also always available
      to be sought happily, whether it is something like family and friends, or
      a beautiful sunset.
    </p>
    <p>Thank you for your time.</p>
