    <p>Dear audience,</p>
    <p>
      Today, I would like to speak to you about veganism, and how it relates to
      Aue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, Aue does not explictly mention veganism, but hopefully you will
      come to see that it is not only an important topic, but important to Aue
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      As defined by the Vegan Society, veganism is a philosophy and way of
      living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all
      forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or
      any other purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The definition uses strong wording: as far as possible and practicable. It
      frames humanity's use of animals for food, clothing, and other purposes as
      nothing less than exploitation or cruelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do happen to be living a lifestyle of using and consuming the body
      parts and excretions of non-human animals, absurdly I would hope that you
      do not consider it cruel. If you did perceive it as cruel, and continued
      imbibing in spite of this, I would hope you find the help and courage you
      need to align with your own moral compass, in the spirit of verse
      <i>l</i> - seek peace to woe incited, inflicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, it is virtually inarguable that <i>most</i> of Aue's verses can
      be understood to support veganism. Starting with verse <i>f</i> -
      evolution gave joy & woe, sentience; this makes us aware that a faculty
      possessed by most of the animals humanity exploits experience joy and woe.
      In secular terms, animals <i>do</i> suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know animals do suffer due in part to the social bonds we can form with
      some animals, and through verses <i>n</i> and <i>o</i>: believe critically
      in science; wield for joy and grow it. Through observation and experiment,
      accident and tragedy, we increasingly understand the depth of their
      sentience; and increasingly conclude our universal ability to thrive on a
      plant based diet from cradle to grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verses <i>g</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>k</i> and <i>m</i> all speak to
      the importance of empathy; the importance of compassion; the importance of
      understanding woe and acting upon that knowledge, unconditionally; and
      showing Aue beside woe naively fed.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear audience, I do believe by this very sermon I speak against woe
      naively fed, that we can so easily close our eyes to the brutality of all
      forms of animal use. That we can deafen ourselves to the cries of the
      bereft mother cows, the mutilated piglets, the crippled hens, the
      terrified veal calves, the neglected lambs, the defenceless fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is woeful that so many people wantonly accept the convenient lies and
      institutional apathy of animal agriculture, businesses, relatives, and
      friends; and our self assurances.
    </p>
    <p>
      I personally know that if somebody was harming an animal in front of me I
      would not be idle in coming to that animal's aid. And so I know I could
      not excuse myself from paying somebody to harm an animal on my behalf,
      whether at a local slaughterhouse or half a world away.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it is difficult to disengage from the norm. It is made difficult
      not only by the breadth of the personal change, but also by the profiteers
      of animal agriculture that know they are no longer needed in modern times,
      and must work hard to keep us consuming their products of death and
      exploitation. But we can help each other, we can educate ourselves, we can
      be brave and extend our empathy to some of the most innocent of victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am here for you. All those who are vegan are here for you. There are
      animals right now and throughout the rest of your life who can be spared.
    </p>
    <p>Think sensibly for Aue; believe in it & your abilities.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your time.</p>
