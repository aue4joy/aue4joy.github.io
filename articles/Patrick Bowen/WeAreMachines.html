      Previously, other species were considered mechanical objects, unable to truly experience pain,
      suffering, love or desire; that they simply responded to biomechanical urges. We have
      progressed beyond this perception, though continue to subject billions of verifiably sentient
      beings to suffering each year (animal agriculture, human slavery, oppression, etc). I however
      argue: we <i>are</i> biomachines, yet still deserve alleviation from suffering.

    <h2>The nature of a machine</h2>
    <p>
      A machine may be defined as "a device of fixed and moving parts that modifies mechanical
      energy and transmits it in a more useful form." This can describe a human: we eat food and do
      work outsmarting nature to reproduce. People who respect evolution should agree with this.
      However, some may see this process as a vehicle for a hallowed personality, consciousness,
      subjective reality, and perhaps soul.

    <p>
      Yet science concludes that the mind is wholly a part of the body. Social and conscious
      abilities arise through evolution as unique adaptation. We experience physical pain, but as
      with some other animals emotional pain too, as within ancestors
      <a href="/PatrickBowen/OurSurvivors/">this was a winning mutation</a>. We are in fact vehicles
      for our genes&mdash;no more than genetic code.

    <h2>Some things hurt some of the time</h2>
    <p>
      Do twigs suffer snapping, bugs suffer cannibalism by a mate, dogs suffer a stepped on tail,
      spreadsheets suffer arithmetic errors? Until science concludes otherwise, I use this litmus
      test: has the being naturally been able to do anything about it? A twig will not unsnap
      itself, cannibalism favourably evolved in some bugs, and spreadsheets present their errors to
      a user rather than pop a few pills. A dog, in contrast, can move away from its pain&mdash;it
      needs to. Pain is an evolutionary adaptation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all know pain feels unpleasant and avoidance of pain is ideal. It matters&mdash;you and I
      <i>are</i> biomechanical machines, with mechanisms to feel pain to avoid the cause of it. To
      argue that pain is a goal or favourable is either observing a biological vestige on its way to
      correction, or wrong. Pain may be means to a favourable end, but it is not a goal.

    <h2>To be unborn</h2>
    <p>
      Antinatalists argue that to live is to potentially suffer, and that this ethically recommends
      abstaining from reproduction, as to not further this injustice. This deserves its own article
      at some point, and once it is written I shall link it here.
