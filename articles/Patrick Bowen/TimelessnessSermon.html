  <p>Dear audience,</p>
  <p>
    Today, I want to talk about a certain aspect of our religion&mdash;its
    timelessness.
  </p>
  <p>
    I find this to be a valuable consideration, helping connect us to those of
    the past, and the future, reassuring us of Aue's worth.
  </p>
  <p>There is advantage in the quality over quantity that Aue employs.</p>
  <p>
    We are left, to the disappointment of those accustomed to religious tomes,
    to "connect the dots", to "fill in the blanks" with our adherence.
  </p>
  <p>We are advised only, in verse a, to think sensibly for Aue.</p>
  <p>
    We are asked in verse c to cite it for joy, despite there only being fifteen
    verses to cite.
  </p>
  <p>
    And yet I find this to be wise, choosing to isolate and focus on the essence
    of life, and making adherence fit personal journey and circumstance.
  </p>
  <p>Aue could speak of capitalism, or homelessness, or poverty.</p>
  <p>
    It could explicitly steer us through technological upheaval, or climate
    change, or pandemic.
  </p>
  <p>But it doesn't. These are not permanent features of life.</p>
  <p>
    They, largely, did not exist in the past, and I implore you to join me in
    trusting that they can be solved, even within this millennium.
  </p>
  <p>
    So much of organised religion today draws upon texts concerned with problems
    made irrelevant by unforeseen advancement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, so deep are these concerns that they often deny the very
    existence of human solutions, or change, or progress.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some teachings can become so stale as to cause harm to others, and the
    adherent themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even geographical location is fought over, without regard to shifting
    tectonic plates, or our eventual future among the stars.
  </p>
  <p>Conversely, no part of Aue shall ever become redundant.</p>
  <p>
    Each verse could find itself ten thousand years in the past, or in the
    future, and their relevance, importance, and synergy would not diminish.
  </p>
  <p>Of course, religion such as Aue did not exist in the past.</p>
  <p>
    In our collective prehistory, our ancestors did not have science, or
    literacy, or conception of the material nature of our existence.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, permanent is the innate understanding of humanity that we are
    deeply, inexorably rooted in nature and the people around us.
  </p>
  <p>
    As in verse j, nature and society is our habitat, something we should never
    forget, and never reject, or deny.
  </p>
  <p>
    And as in verse d, nature, so body, so mind, are of now, we are reminded of
    our emergence, our transience, our composition, in and of the natural world.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is not something we will ever escape, nor should we need to&mdash;it is a
    fact of life.
  </p>
  <p>
    No matter how augmented we might make ourselves with technology, compassion
    will still be fundamental, death will still be final, and life will remain
    diverse.
  </p>
  <p>
    The assertion of verse f, evolution gave joy and woe, sentience, means we
    will forever be a product of this process.
  </p>
  <p>
    This makes certain that any conscious being, whether completely alien to us
    or just our distant descendants, will be subject to joy, and to woe.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any person that can read Aue, in its original English, or translated, and
    internalise it, could benefit from adherence.
  </p>
  <p>
    Timelessness, then, is a great virtue of Aue, and one that I hope you will
    reflect upon.
  </p>
  <p>Thank you for your time.</p>
