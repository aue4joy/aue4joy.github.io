      Aue is still an open doctrine, meaning it is subject to change. I intend
      for it to remain open doctrine until I die, so that any experience I gain
      throughout my life is not prematurely excluded. However, I do try to
      ensure that changes I do make are deeply considered, well thought out,
      infrequent, and retain the original spirit of Aue.

    <h2>The realisations</h2>
    <p>
      Since its introduction, I have not been entirely happy with verse
      <i>m</i>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>Show Aue beside woe naively fed.</blockquote>
    <p>
      I have not been unhappy with its underlying message, but that it is not
      very accessible. It is too metaphorical, and I personally prefer
      &ldquo;naïveté&rdquo; but did not want to introduce inaccessible
      characters.
    </p>
    <p>In August 2023 I thought to slightly shorten verse <i>b</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>believe in it & your abilities.</blockquote>
    <p>
      Not only does it still make sense grammatically to make
      &ldquo;abilities&rdquo; singular, but when translating into other
      languages a more appropriate word could be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 20th of Febuary 2024, after this question from an Eastern Orthodox
      Christian concerning verse <i>b</i> during an Aue Hour:
    </p>
    <blockquote>how can you believe / trust in man made things?</blockquote>
    <p>I pondered verse <i>n</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>Believe critically in science;</blockquote>
    <p>
      As while speaking with them I essentially argued that we build trust with
      scientific institutions, which means faith in them is not necessary, which
      contradicts Aue asking one to have faith (believe) in science. While I
      would hope that adherents can have a trustful relationship with Aue,
      initially all adherence will start with faith, so verse <i>b</i> is still
      somewhat sound in this regard.

    <h2>The changes</h2>
    <p>In light of these realisations, the new verses are as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&#8230;</p>
      <p><i>b</i> believe in it & your ability.</p>
      <p>&#8230;</p>
      <p><i>m</i> Show Aue amid woe of misjudgment.</p>
      <p><i>n</i> Build trust in science;</p>
      <p>&#8230;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The change to verse <i>b</i> is obvious: &ldquo;abilities&rdquo; becomes
      &ldquo;ability&rdquo;, which is shorter and more impactful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The change to verse <i>m</i> is hopefully much clearer for people to
      understand. It still relates to the same nature of woe;
      &ldquo;beside&rdquo; becomes a hopefully clearer &ldquo;amid&rdquo;; the
      &ldquo;fed&rdquo; metaphor has been dropped; &ldquo;misjudgement&rdquo;
      better characterises the lack of better choices that somebody could make
      in order to rectify the woe, and feels less immutable and more precise
      than being <i>naïve</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The change to verse <i>n</i> now has it be a call-to-action, to not only
      improve the trust an adherent has with science, but to also build trust
      others have with it; and this concept should be more accurate than belief.
      The adverb &ldquo;critically&rdquo; has been dropped, as in order to build
      true trust it is necessary that it be critical, along with many other
      aspects which are also omitted.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Along with updates to the Spanish and Italian translations, I hoped an
      additional full translation to Bisaya (Cebuano) would accompany the
      changes, but I have been unable to do this in a reasonable time-frame. In
      the meantime, the partial translation has been released along with these
      changes to the website.
