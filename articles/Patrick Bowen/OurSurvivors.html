    <h4>Why should we care?</h4>
    <p>
      For a long time my answer to this question was: we shouldn't care. Even the latest past
      generations of my family were uninteresting. Their successes and failures are concluded, their
      mundane lives lost, their views aged, their genes so diluted in my blood. To feel pride or
      disgust would be like judging anybody else, and to understand their era I have only look at
      better kept records and diaries. Only at a local level of history could they possibly become
      noteworthy. Right?
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike most people, I unfortunately have wasted a few years of my conscious life ignoring my
      past and distant relatives. It took going from the top-down rather than the bottom-up to make
      me realise it wasn't so lame after all.

    <h4>Top-down</h4>
    <p>
      Appreciating evolution isn't complete without realising we have been and are subject to the
      exact same path as all other life. We are only recently unique to be able to afford complex
      partner selection, no longer dictated by survival. But we still have myriad "primal" urges,
      bias, heuristics, focuses, and innate abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Distilling some of these, there are some we can deem "human". Note: the following is opinion,
      and I'm curious to see academic conclusions. Many aspects of nature are alluring, but fire and
      the ocean are two I would like to focus on.

    <h4>Fire</h4>
    <p>
      Our ancestors, and even some <i>Homo</i> cousins such as <i>Homo neanderthalensis</i>,
      mastered fire, and its benefits were essential to our success. If you have an unexplainable
      draw to the light of a candle, the heat of a bonfire, the power of arson, I feel it's our
      survivors we have to credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Our survivors</i> are those in the past whom survived, period. And of those, a healthy
      relationship of fire would be a major advantage. If their genes dictated baulking at any
      smoke, pyrophobia, or fear of arson, survival would be threatened. Caution of heat and flames
      alongside this makes for an almost mystical appreciation.

    <h4>The ocean</h4>
    <p>
      I think there are indeed many people who are awed by the sight, smell, environment, and
      potential of any vast body of water. I find it no surprise, as once again
      <i>our survivors</i> which harboured such attraction would fair better. Hydrophobia,
      agoraphobia, or just simple boredom would have one miss out on all its potential. Similarly,
      without respect for the might, a survivor may have become fish food.
    </p>

    <h4>Why we should care</h4>
    <p>
      There are incredible fictions to be made from this perspective. Think of the ancient tribes
      whose fear of the dark saved them from terrible beasts, humanity only a few genes away at any
      time from this possibly helpful mutation. Similarly, all courage, all love, all confidence and
      mastery came from our time-tested social species. Know it stretches back and has grown for one
      hundred thousand years.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, better still, focus on your heritage. While it has had ostensibly less impact on who you
      are than ten thousand <i>Homo sapiens</i> generations, they are more uniquely you than any
      other creature. Understanding your family can give understanding of yourself. Though, if you
      are unable to peer into your past, rest assured we're all of the same family regardless.
