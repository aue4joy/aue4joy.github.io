    <p> Here is a meeting format I have devised for a weekly &ldquo;Aue Hour&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>Inspiration: <i>cghilmo</i>.</p>
    <ol>
      <li> start audio recording once there are two or more people in the meeting </li>
      <li> verbally gain consent from all members for public recording </li>
      <li> wait up to ten minutes for all members who expressed interest to arrive </li>
      <li> conduct a reading of Aue </li>
      <li> open discussion </li>
      <li> after one hour, end the recording </li>
    </ol>
