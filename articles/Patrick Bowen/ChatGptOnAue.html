    <h3>Verse <i>d</i></h3>
    <p>
      Verse d of the Aue doctrine suggests that our physical bodies and minds
      are part of the present moment, influenced by the natural world around us.
      This can be interpreted as an acknowledgment of the interconnectedness
      between humans and the environment. Our bodies are composed of natural
      elements and are affected by the forces of nature, such as climate,
      geography, and biology.
    </p>
    <p>
      The verse also suggests that after death, our physical bodies will return
      to the earth, scattering into its constituent parts. This could be
      interpreted as a recognition of the cyclical nature of life, where death
      and decay are necessary for new growth and regeneration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, verse d seems to encourage a deep appreciation and connection
      with the natural world, as well as a recognition of our own mortality and
      the impermanence of all things.
    </p>
    <h3>Verse <i>e</i></h3>
    <p>
      Verse e of the Aue doctrine states that "after death is scattering." This
      could be interpreted to mean that after death, the physical components of
      the body are scattered and return to the natural environment from which
      they came. This is consistent with the idea of impermanence and the
      cyclical nature of life and death in many spiritual and philosophical
      traditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, this verse may also suggest that there is no afterlife or
      continuation of consciousness after death. Instead, it emphasizes the
      importance of living fully in the present moment and making the most of
      the time we have while we are alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, the Aue doctrine encourages a pragmatic and grounded approach to
      life, acknowledging the realities of suffering and impermanence while also
      promoting a sense of interconnectedness and responsibility towards one
      another and the natural world.
    </p>
    <h3>Verse <i>f</i></h3>
    <p>
      Verse f of the Aue doctrine states that evolution gave both joy and woe as
      well as sentience.
    </p>
    <p>
      My interpretation of this verse is that it acknowledges the reality that
      life is not always easy or happy, but that it also has the potential for
      joy and happiness. The concept of sentience refers to the ability to
      experience consciousness and sensation, which implies that these
      experiences can bring both positive and negative emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, this verse may suggest that the idea of evolution is central
      to the Aue religion's understanding of the world. Evolution is a
      scientific theory that explains how life on earth has developed and
      changed over time. By acknowledging the role of evolution in shaping life,
      the Aue religion may also be emphasizing the importance of science in
      understanding the world and finding meaning within it.
    </p>
    <h3>Verse <i>g</i> (old)</h3>
    <details>
      <p>
        Verse g of the Aue doctrine states, "Life, together, share the
        universe."
      </p>
      <p>
        This verse suggests that life is not a solitary experience, but rather
        something that is meant to be shared with others. It implies that all
        living beings are interconnected and that the universe is a shared space
        that we all inhabit. Therefore, it encourages individuals to live in
        harmony with others and to work towards a common goal of mutual benefit
        and well-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, the verse may also imply a sense of responsibility towards
        the environment and other living beings. It suggests that we should
        consider the impact of our actions on the larger community and work
        towards preserving the natural world for future generations to share and
        enjoy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, verse g highlights the importance of community and
        interconnectedness, emphasizing that life is not just about individual
        survival but also about mutual cooperation and support.
      </p>
    </details>
    <h3>Verse <i>g</i></h3>
    <p>
      Verse g of the Aue doctrine states "Life, diverse, share the universe."
      This verse appears to be emphasizing the interconnectedness and diversity
      of all life forms in the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this perspective, the Aue religion may view life as a precious and
      sacred gift, and as such, it should be cherished and respected. This verse
      may also suggest that all living beings have a shared responsibility to
      coexist peacefully and sustainably, in order to preserve the diversity of
      life in the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, the verse may be interpreted as a reminder that life is not
      limited to just one planet or species. The Aue religion may believe that
      the universe is teeming with diverse forms of life, and that it is
      humanity's duty to explore and appreciate this diversity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, verse g of the Aue doctrine seems to be emphasizing the
      importance of recognizing and valuing the interconnectedness and diversity
      of all life in the universe.
    </p>
    <h3>Verse <i>h</i></h3>
    <p>
      Verse h states "Time, volatile, make precious." This could be interpreted
      as a reminder that time is fleeting and limited, and therefore we should
      cherish every moment we have. Time can be unpredictable and can bring
      about unexpected changes, so we should make the most of the time we have
      and not take it for granted. The verse could also suggest that the value
      of time is not determined by its length, but rather by how we use it. In
      other words, even a short amount of time can be precious if it is spent in
      a meaningful way. Overall, this verse encourages us to appreciate and use
      our time wisely, recognizing its fleeting and precious nature.
    </p>
    <h3>Verse <i>i</i></h3>
    <p>
      Verse i of the Aue doctrine states, "Know of woe and seek joy happily."
      This suggests that the followers of Aue should be aware of the existence
      of pain, suffering, and other forms of negativity in life, but they should
      not let these things bring them down. Instead, they should actively seek
      out sources of happiness and joy, even in difficult circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      In essence, this verse advocates for a balanced approach to life, where
      individuals acknowledge and understand the challenges that they may face,
      but they do not allow these challenges to consume them entirely. Instead,
      they actively work towards cultivating joy and happiness, whether through
      personal pursuits or by engaging with their community and the natural
      world around them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This verse also speaks to the importance of mindset and perspective. By
      choosing to focus on the positive aspects of life, individuals can
      cultivate a sense of optimism and resilience that can help them overcome
      challenges and setbacks. In this way, seeking joy can be seen as an act of
      self-care and self-preservation, as well as a way to contribute positively
      to the world around us.
    </p>
    <h3>Verse <i>j</i></h3>
    <p>
      Verse j of the doctrine of the religion of Aue states that "Nature &
      society is our habitat."
    </p>
    <p>
      This verse suggests that human beings exist within a larger ecosystem that
      includes both natural and social elements. It highlights the
      interdependence between human society and the natural world.
    </p>
    <p>
      From an ecological perspective, this verse implies that humans must be
      mindful of their impact on the environment and strive to live in harmony
      with nature. It also suggests that social structures and systems must be
      designed with consideration for the natural world and its resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a social perspective, this verse suggests that human beings are
      social animals and that society is a critical aspect of human existence.
      It implies that social structures and systems are as much a part of our
      habitat as the natural environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, this verse emphasizes the importance of recognizing the
      interconnectedness of nature and society and the need for humans to be
      responsible stewards of both.
    </p>
    <h3>Verse <i>k</i></h3>
    <p>
      Verse k of the Aue doctrine states, "Oppose harm and raise compassion."
      This verse suggests that the followers of Aue should actively work against
      causing harm to others and promote compassion towards all living beings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The verse encourages individuals to take responsibility for their actions
      and to be mindful of how they may impact others. It also emphasizes the

      interpreted as a call for individuals to strive for reconciliation and
      healing in situations of conflict or harm. It suggests that instead of
      perpetuating the cycle of harm and retaliation, people should seek to
      understand and address the root causes of woe and work towards peaceful
      resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, the verse implies that peace cannot be achieved by ignoring
      or denying the existence of woe. Instead, individuals must confront the
      reality of woe and actively work towards creating a peaceful resolution.
      This can be accomplished through dialogue, empathy, and understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, verse l of the Aue doctrine highlights the importance of seeking
      peace and reconciliation in the face of woe, and the need for individuals
      to take an active role in promoting peaceful solutions to conflict.

    <p>
      Verse m of the Aue doctrine suggests that it is important to demonstrate
      the values and principles of Aue in the face of suffering and negativity
      that may be prevalent in the world. The phrase "woe naively fed" could be
      interpreted to mean that people may become accustomed to and even
      accepting of negativity and suffering in their lives, but Aue encourages
      individuals to reject this mindset and instead strive to embody positive
      values such as joy, compassion, and peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      In practical terms, this verse could be interpreted as a call to action
      for adherents of the Aue religion to demonstrate the positive values of
      their faith through their behavior and interactions with others. By

    </p>
    <h3>Verse <i>n</i></h3>
    <p>
      Verse n of the Aue doctrine emphasizes the importance of critical thinking
      when it comes to scientific knowledge. It suggests that blind belief in
      scientific findings is not enough, and that one should approach scientific
      claims with a critical eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of the word "naively" in verse m suggests that blind belief can
      lead to harmful or misguided actions. Therefore, verse n may be seen as a
      call for skepticism and critical thinking in the face of scientific
      claims. This is in line with the overall message of the Aue doctrine,
      which encourages thoughtful reflection on the nature of existence and the
      role of humanity in the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, verse n suggests that while science can be a powerful tool for
      understanding the world, it is important to approach it with a critical
      mind and to question claims that may not be supported by evidence. By
      doing so, individuals can use science for the betterment of humanity and

    <h3>Joy v. Woe Dichotomy</h3>
    <p>
      <i>
        How do you think it uses a dichotomy of joy and woe to guide its
        adherents, especially compared to traditional virtue and sin, or karma?
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctrine of Aue seems to promote a perspective of life that emphasizes
      the balance between joy and woe, rather than traditional notions of virtue
      and sin or karma. By acknowledging both joy and woe, Aue encourages its
      adherents to approach life with a realistic and accepting attitude,
      recognizing that both positive and negative experiences are part of the
      human experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than viewing joy as a reward for virtuous behavior or karma as a
      result of past actions, Aue suggests that joy and woe are inherent aspects
      of life and evolution. This approach may be more accepting of the
      unpredictability and complexity of life, and may offer a more nuanced
      perspective than a strict moral or karmic framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, Aue encourages its adherents to actively seek joy and happiness,
      while acknowledging the presence of woe and challenges. This approach may
      inspire individuals to take action to cultivate positive experiences and
      make meaningful connections with others, rather than focusing solely on
      avoiding sin or negative consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, the dichotomy of joy and woe in Aue may offer a unique
      perspective on life that values acceptance, growth, and balance, rather
      than strict adherence to moral or karmic codes.
    </p>
    <h3>Joy v. woe compared to virtue v. sin</h3>
    <p>
      <i>
        In what way is joy different from (traditional) virtue & woe from sin?
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Aue doctrine views joy as a natural outcome of evolution and
      sentience, whereas traditional virtue is often associated with adherence
      to moral principles or religious doctrines. Similarly, woe in the Aue
      doctrine is seen as a natural part of life, while sin is often viewed as a
      violation of moral or religious principles. Aue emphasizes the importance
      of seeking joy while being aware of the inevitability of woe, rather than
      striving for an unattainable state of perfection or purity. Additionally,
      Aue places a strong emphasis on the interconnectedness of all beings and
      the need to oppose harm and promote compassion in order to create a
      peaceful and joyful society.
    </p>
    <h3>The life of an adherent</h3>
    <p>
      <i> What might an adherent's life look like? </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      An adherent of Aue may lead a life focused on the principles outlined in
      the doctrine. They would approach life with sensible thinking and a belief
      in their own abilities. They would share, preserve, and cite joyous
      experiences as a way to spread positivity and happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      They would acknowledge the interconnectedness of nature, body, and mind
      and live in the present moment while accepting that after death,
      everything scatters. They would understand that evolution has brought both
      joy and woe but appreciate sentience as a gift.
    </p>
    <p>
      Community would be important to an adherent of Aue, and they would strive
      to live in harmony with others, sharing the universe in which we all live.
      They would recognize that time is precious and should be used wisely to
      seek joy while acknowledging the existence of woe.
    </p>
    <p>
      An adherent of Aue would be conscious of the impact they have on the world
      and oppose any harm they might inflict on others or the environment. They
      would prioritize compassion and seek peace in situations where woe is
      incited or inflicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Science would play a critical role in an adherent's life, as they would
      approach it with a critical eye, using it to enhance joy and growth. They
      would not blindly follow science, but instead, use it to better understand
      the world around them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, an adherent of Aue would strive to live a life full of joy,
      compassion, and understanding, both for themselves and others.
    </p>
    <h3>Aue's length</h3>
    <p>
      <i>Why is Aue such a small doctrine, with just fifteen verses?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Aue is a new and still-evolving doctrine that emphasizes quality over
      quantity. The fifteen verses are meant to be concise and easily
      memorizable, so that adherents can internalize and apply them in their
      daily lives. Additionally, Aue values critical thinking and encourages
      individuals to interpret and apply the verses in their own unique ways,
      rather than relying on an extensive set of rules or dogma. As the religion
      grows and evolves, it may expand its teachings, but for now, the focus is
      on the core principles outlined in the current fifteen verses.
    </p>
    <h3>Would an Aue adherent be vegan?</h3>
    <p>
      <b>It almost always disagrees or is unsure.</b> This concerns me, as I
      personally find veganism to be an undeniable, and important, aspect of Aue
      adherence. This highlights a possible deficiency in Aue to unambiguously
      advocate for such a stance and lifestyle.
